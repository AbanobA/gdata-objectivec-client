#summary GData Objective-C Client Framework Design Document

= Document Audience =

The audience for this document is developers who will be maintaining
or extending the GData Objective-C Client Framework.

Readers should already be familiar with the introductory document GDataObjCIntroduction.

= Project Goals =

The GData framework is intended to make it easy for Cocoa applications to interact with Google services.

The framework handles parsing and generation of XML, http network transactions, and authentication (account sign-in).

The framework does not provide user-interface, but the object interfaces should work smoothly with KVC and Cocoa bindings.

The framework relies on AppKit's NSXMLDocument for parsing and generating XML text. Internally, the framework builds GData objects from and generates NSXMLNodes.

= Framework Objects =

The framework defines these kinds of objects:

  * Elements, which can be created by or generate XML.  Elements include
    * Entries, derived from GDataEntryBase
    * Feeds, derived from GDataFeedBase, containing lists of entries
    * Individual data types, which may optionally be usable as extensions

  * Data-type helpers, such as GDataDateTime

  * Services, which handle sign-in and networking
    * Service tickets, which track server requests and responses

  * Queries, which provide a convenient way to create request URLs

= GDataObjects =

Objects in the framework which parse or generate XML are derived from the base class GDataObject.  Each subclass of GDataObject should implement these methods:

{{{
- (id)initWithXMLElement:(NSXMLElement *)element
                  parent:(GDataObject *)parent; // parses the XML
- (NSXMLElement *)XMLElement; // generates the XML
}}}
along with these usual NSObject methods,
{{{
- (id)copyWithZone:(NSZone *)zone;
- (NSString *)description; // entries and feeds may implement -itemsForDescription instead
- (id)copyWithZone:(NSZone *)zone; (be sure to call superclass)
- (BOOL)isEqual:(GDataObject *)other; (be sure to call superclass)
}}}

= Contents of the GDataObject base class =



Each GDataObject includes a userData member that is reserved for use by the client application.
